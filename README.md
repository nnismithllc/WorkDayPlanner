# WorkDayPlanner

## Description 

This is a Work Day schedule planner that allows you to enter data into the time-blocks and save information per hour. The time blocks are scheduled from 9am to 5pm with additional floating notes for previous days or information that is outside of work hours. The planner text box has color-codes based on the time, each which indicates if its past (blue violet), present (green), or future (crimson) concerning that day. The save button allows you to store information in the local storage for later use, and the reset button allows you to erase all information for new information daily or whenever you need to erase data. 

## Installation

You need internet access to operate this file. If you are trying to edit the data, you will need a coding program (ie Visual Studio Code) Node.js, which will include a html file, script file, and style sheet.


## Usage 

Use to plan your daily schedule notes and information for your 9am-5pm time-blocks.
